- The Daytona SDK provides interfaces for Python and TypeScript to programmatically manage development environments and execute code in isolated sandboxes. Key features include setting up environment variables through a DaytonaConfig class, performing file system operations (listing, creating directories, reading/writing files), Git operations (cloning, status, branch management), and process/code execution. Sandboxes can be created with specific languages or custom images, and they persist filesystem data across their lifecycle with different states (Running, Stopped, Archived) for cost management. The SDK also supports Language Server Protocol for code completion and diagnostics.
